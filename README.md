## How to set up Better for your organization

Better mirrors your [Github issues](https://github.com/better-feedback/roadmap/issues) to a [hosted website](https://roadmap.betterhq.org/), which allows your community to vote on them, fund them as bounties and claim the pooled funds for implementing them. Issues can range from feature requests, to content marketing ideas and DAO grant proposals.

Setting up your own Better project takes a few steps:

- Fork the [Better repo](https://github.com/better-feedback/roadmap)
- Host the site by creating a project on [Vercel]([url](https://vercel.com/))
    - Set your ENV variables based on `./.env.example` (Got any questions? Hit us up on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wwwwRFa6aj)!)

After a successful deployment, point your Vercel deployment to your custom URL: eg. feedback.yourdapp.com, roadmap.yourdapp.com, bounties.yourdapp.com

- Copy your DNS info at `https://vercel.com/[yourproject]/[yourrepo]/settings/domains`
- Add the info to your domain manager
- Send us your domain name on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wwwwRFa6aj), so we can whitelist your domain for github authentication!

ðŸŽŠ Congratulations, you are hosting your own Better board ðŸŽ‰

- When using a private repo, make sure to add our notification bot `betterhq-bot` as contributor.
